# noobdroid.com
Check the website first.
Website is currently running on Wordpress but in the future we will shift to a HTML, CSS and JS.


noobdroid.com is a tech blog for beginners to help them learn Android Dev faster.
The website will provide a tool for both beginner & advanced coders to code faster and recall syntax better when working in the Android environment (by using custom boilerplate code called cheat-codes to pseudocode).

This will be a FOSS (Free Open Source Software) project but we will follow a certain structure when taking contributions. 

WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE?

This is a project that keeps in mind the varying interests and expertise level of the different members of the community. But one common goal for the community is learning Android. So, every single member, no matter the experience or level, can contribute in making tutorials for the different topics in Android.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE?

We will have 6 groups of contributors -

1) DESIGN - works on the ui/ux portion of the website by collaborating with others to find a common design solution to fit everyones needs.

2) WORDPRESS - works on updating content on the WordPress dashboard using pre-made templates from DESIGN.

3) CONTENT - works on creating content in the form of cheat-codes, conceptuals, guides & tutorials for different concepts in Android - from beginner to advanced.

4) FLUTTER - works on the brainstorming of the flutter section of the website and will be completely responsible for making it a reality.

5) WEBSITE - works on replicating the existing website using HTML, CSS & JS.

6) ADMIN - you will work with other members in your group to coordinate with the different groups and ensure that things are progressing. If you have a strong tendancy for management, then this role might be apt for you.

Note that if you're interested in learning something, lets say Wordpress and you have no experience, you can still join the Wordpress group to learn things on the fly. If you're confused about any of these roles and require more clarity, give me a shout @ 

ashwanth1109@gmail.com (or) ashwanth.a.r@duke.edu (or) @Ashwanth (slack handle)

Once you've decided which groups you'd like to work with, complete the following steps to become a contributor and one of us will reach out to you to follow up:

STEP 1 - GO TO THE "List of Contributors" FILE AND EDIT IT ON A SEPARATE BRANCH

STEP 2 - ADD YOUR FULL NAME, CHOICE OF CONTRIBUTOR ROLES AND YOUR UNIQUE 2 DIGIT MEMBER ID [00 - 99]. (Note: Pick one that is not already taken)

STEP 3 - CREATE A PULL REQUEST

Structure for taking contributions - 

Point #1:
We will use version control (GitHub) as our workflow model. Any changes to be made should be made on a separate branch. Branch should be named (e.g.)'Feature: ViewGroup Tutorial (by Member #05)'

Point #2:
If you only have a few minutes per day to contribute, we suggest working in the content group. Since all of us are taking the courses at Udacity, making tutorials for concepts you're already learning is something you can do in a few minutes.
